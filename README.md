# About me ðŸ‘‹
I am currently working on a system identification project.\
I am currently learning Python programming and Raspberry Pi implementation.\
The best way to reach me is through my email (XanderDMosley.Engineer@gmail.com).\
Fun fact: I have memorized around fifty digits of Pi<sup>â€ </sup>.

â€  Tau is the superior circular constant.
